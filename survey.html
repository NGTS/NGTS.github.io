<h1>NGTS Survey</h1>

<div class="rightimage" style="width: 400px">

<div class="imgcaption">
Parameter space for transit detection with the yellow area indicating
the prime science parameter space search of NGTS. Transit depth is
indicated as a function of planet and star radius. Approximate
spectral types of stars are also indicated, as well as the radii of
representative Solar system planets. Known transiting systems are
marked in green where they were discovered in ground-based transit
surveys, blue if they were originally identified in radial velocity
surveys, and red if they were discovered from space.
</div>
</div>
NGTS is designed to reach 1mmag accuracy over a wide field, with the
prime objective of detecting transiting Neptune size planets. From the
ground, assuming a precision of 1 mmag, for wide-field small-size
telescopes, the most optimal targets are K and early M stars.<P>


The optical system is therefore designed to observe with optimal sensitivity in
the 600 to 900nm range, in order to match the peak emission of the
primary targets (K and early M).<P>

Following the results from HARPS planet surveys on
super-Earths, the work from Howard et al. 2010 as well as
the results from <a href="http://kepler.arc.nasa.gov/">Kepler</a>, one can consider a conservative
planet occurrence of typically 5% for Neptune size planets with
periods shorter than 10 days (corresponding to an average transit
probability of about 5%). One then finds that a minimum sample of
about 40,000 stars needs to be monitored to detect about 100
transiting planets of this kind. With the additional constraint to
identify these planets on bright stars, to ensure an optimal
capability for follow-up observations, we consider a V magnitude of
13th as the practical faint limit.  For M stars a fainter V-magnitude
down to 15th may be considered in view of the smaller mass of the star
and the larger radial-velocity amplitude expected.  An
additional benefit of staying in this magnitude range is the limited
crowding factor, which is less than 20% for our PSF, even for a field
30 degrees from the Galactic plane.<P>

NGTS is designed to find 2 - 10 Earth radius planets around stars brighter
than 13th mag (orange region).
Kepler's planets are mostly found around fainter stars (purple dots).
The previous SuperWASP survey was limited to Jupiter-sized planets (pink
dots). The green circles indicate planets orbiting stars bright enough for
their atmospheres to be studied with techniques such as transmission
spectroscopy. The diagonal lines indicate the limits of radial velocity
measurments (to the left of these lines, the planets' massess cannot be
determined with current technology).

<P>

Our simulations suggest we will detect 
~140 sub-Neptune sized planets bright enough (V<15) for confirmation and mass determination with HARPS and the forthcoming ESPRESSO instrument on the <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/">VLT</a>, and hence their bulk composition. We should also find 
~20 sub-Neptune or Super-Earth sized planets bright enough (I<11) for detailed atmospheric characterisation with a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/e-elt/">E-ELT</a>, <a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">JWST</a>, and <a href="http://cheops.unibe.ch/">CHEOPS</a>, as well as  
>100 new hot Jupiters.<P>


The most fundamental result from Kepler is the statistical information
gathered on Neptune and large Earth-like planets. NGTS is designed to
detect this planet population around brighter stars, allowing
systematic follow-up of planetary structure and atmospheric
composition. Kepler candidates are mostly too faint to be studied in this detail. Interestingly the period distribution of small planets
significantly rises above 4 days, motivating a facility with good
detection efficiency in the 4 to 10 day period range. <P>


The 600-900nm wavelength region includes strong water bands whose
rapid variations could degrade the quality of the photometry by adding
short-term variable color effects. The superb dry conditions 
of the Paranal site in this
respect crucially enhances the discovery potential of the
survey. Another key parameter affecting the final planet catch is the
number of clear nights per year. These factors have driven the
selection of Paranal as the site for NGTS.<P>
