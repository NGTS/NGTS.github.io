The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is a wide-field photometric
survey designed primarily to discover and characterise transiting exoplanets of 
Neptune-size and smaller around bright stars (magnitude V<13).

<P>NGTS employs an array of small fully-robotic telescopes operating at red-optical wavelengths (520-890nm) thereby maximizing sensitivity to bright but
  relatively cool and small host stars (K and early-M spectral type). The project is described in detail by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/475/4/4476/4597999">Wheatley et al (2018)</a>. 

<P>We routinely achieve photometric precison of 150 parts per million (ppm), which unprecedented for a wide-field ground-based facility. This high precision has enabled the discovery of exoplanets as small as 3 Earth radii (e.g. NGTS-4b; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.5094W">West et al, 2019</a>).
							   
<P>
  NGTS is sited at the Paranal Observatory, which is the premier site of the <a href ="http://www.eso.org/public/">European Southern Observatory (ESO)</a> in the Attacama Desert in the north of Chile. Paranal is also home to ESO's <a
																												   href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/">Very Large Telescope (VLT)</a>. The site meets strict requirements for low water vapor and excellent photometric conditions.  NGTS was the first external project granted access to the Paranal site, reflecting strong synergy with ESO telescopes that can be used to characterise NGTS exoplanets.

<P>
NGTS also benefits from hardware and software heritage from the <a href="http://www.superwasp.org/">SuperWASP</a> project, which since 2004 has been leading the world in the discovery of transiting exoplanets of Jupiter size.

<P>
NGTS data are publicly available though the <a href="https://archive.eso.org/cms/eso-archive-news/first-data-release-by-the-next-generation-transit-survey.html">ESO Data Archive</a>.

<b>Jun 2019: NGTS-7Ab is an ultra-short period transiting brown dwarf.</b> The orbital period is only 16 hours, and the stars are so close that the brown dwarf has tidally spun-up its young M dwarf host star. Magnetic braking should be decaying the orbit, meaning the stars are likely to merge within a few million years. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08219">Read the full paper on arXiv</a>.
