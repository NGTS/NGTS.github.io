<h1>NGTS Science Programme</h1>

The NGTS is a wide-field observing facility made of a compact ensemble
of telescopes. It is designed to carry out a wide-field search for
transiting planets on bright stars, reaching 1 mmag precision on a
13th V magnitude star. The facility is sited at the <a href ="http://www.eso.org/public/">European Southern Observatory's</a> Paranal Observatory in Chile, 
home of the <a
href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/">VLT</a>, in
order to benefit from the unique weather conditions and strong synergy
with the VLT and later the 
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/e-elt/">E-ELT</a>  
for follow-up science. The whole
facility is designed to be operated in a robotic mode without on-site
observers.<P>

The prime objective of the survey is to search for transiting planets
in the size range of Neptune and below, with diameters between 2 to 5
Earth size on bright stars. The many recent discoveries of planetary
systems harbouring Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths clearly
indicate that low-mass planets around solar-type stars must be very
common. This is reinforced by statistical considerations and by newly developed
planet formation models (Mordasini et al. 2009, A&A, 501,
1161). Nevertheless, the composition and structure of these planets
remains a matter for debate. With the detection of e.g. the close
packed system of super-Earths around Kepler-11 and the extraordinary range of small planets discovered by <a href="http://kepler.arc.nasa.gov/">Kepler</a> it is clear that, as
with the gas giants, there is great diversity in the structure of
super-Earths.<P>

Mass radius relationship of small transiting planets, with Solar
System planets shown for comparison. Planets Kepler-11b to Kepler-11f
are represented by filled circles with 1-sigma error bars, with their
letters written above; values and ranges are as given in Table
1. Other transiting extrasolar planets in this size range are shown as
open squares, representing, in order of ascending radius, Kepler-10b,
CoRoT-7b, GJ 1214b, Kepler-4b, GJ 436b and HAT-P-11b. The triangles
(labeled V, E, U and N) correspond to Venus, Earth, Neptune and
Uranus, respectively.  (Fig from Lissauer et al. 2011)

The special geometry of the orbits of transiting planets severely
constrains the orbital inclinations, allowing an accurate
determination of their masses and radii. This information provides the
key to determining the bulk composition of exoplanets, as well as
their formation and evolution history (e.g. Mazeh et al., 2000, ApJ,
532, L55; Hebb et al., 2009, ApJ, 693, 1920).<P>

Perhaps of even greater importance, the transit geometry offers a
powerful means to probe the atmospheric composition of these
planets. During secondary eclipse, the star occults the thermal
emission from the planet, which can then be computed from comparison
with the total out of transit flux. Thus the emission spectrum of the
planet can be determined, despite the unfavourable luminosity contrast
between planet and host star.  Such observations have been
successfully carried out in space with Spitzer and HST, and also from
the ground with large telescopes like the VLT using e.g. the FORS or HAWK-I instruments.<P>

The observation of the planet during its transit at many different
wavelengths allows us to obtain its transmission spectrum (stellar
light passing through the planet atmosphere). The transmission
spectrum is measured by identifying the small differences in transit
depth as a function of wavelength.  This technique usually requires
extremely high signal to noise data and has been successfully applied
only on a few planets orbiting bright stars, like for example
HD189733b.  However it is a powerful technique measuring the distinct
signature of chemical components in the atmosphere of a planet.  This
technique can be used to search for water on some planets, and even
eventually for biomarkers on rocky planets.  It has been
successfully carried out on GJ1214b, a Neptune type planet, using FORS
observations. However, the discovery of additional bright
targets is essential for this technique to be more widely applied to
planets in the Neptune size range.
