<P>
  NGTS data are publicly available though the <a href="https://archive.eso.org/cms/eso-archive-news/first-data-release-by-the-next-generation-transit-survey.html">ESO Data Archive</a>.

<P>The first data release, NGTS DR1, was made in Nov 2018 and includes data for 24 fields that were completed between the beginning of the NGTS survey in April 2016 and April 2017. NGTS DR1 includes data for more than two hundred thousand sources and a total of 32 billion photometric data points (corresponding to 1.7 TB of data). A second, larger data release is planned for Autumn 2019. 

<P>If you would like advice on using NGTS data in your research, or are interested in forming a collaboration with the NGTS consortium, please don't hesitate to <a href="contacts.html">contact us</a>. 

<P>Please note that any publications making use of NGTS data must include the following acknowledgement: "Based on data collected under the NGTS Project at the ESO La Silla Paranal Observatory."

  <h2>Hints and Tips</h2>

  <P>The first NGTS data release covers relatively small patches of the sky that have been surveyed intensely. These are scattered across the sky, so a cone/box search for individual objects is not a natural way to access the data. 

<P>From the <a href="https://www.eso.org/qi/catalogQuery/index/243">source catalogue query page</a>, just hitting "search & view" without including any coordinates returns a list of all objects in the data release, which can be downloaded in a range of formats. This might be useful if you want to run your own cross match using e.g. topcat. 

<P>If the sesame name resolver doesn't resolve the name of your target, you can try typing the coordinates of any of the sources returned above, which should take you to back to the catalogue entry and confirms the cone search is working. 

<P>It is also possible to run cone/box searches across a list of objects using the "List of targets" tab. 

<P>If you the put the source ID of one of these objects into the <a href="https://www.eso.org/qi/catalogQuery/index/244">light curve catalogue query page</a>, you can see and download the actual photometry.

<P>There are also other ways to access the data through the ESO archive. It is possible to browse the sky footprints of NGTS using the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/cms.html">ESO Science Portal (Processed data)</a>, by (for instance) selecting the NGTS filter from the Filter/Band list. 

<P>It is also possible to find and download the image and photometry fits files for whole fields using the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form">data products form</a>. 
Although note that each NGTS field has been divided into 25 subfields in order to keep the file size manageable for the archive. 

<P>It should help to look at the <a href="http://eso.org/rm/api/v1/public/releaseDescriptions/122">documentation</a>, which includes a list of the fields included in the data release.
