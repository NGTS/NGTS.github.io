  <p class="w3-center"  style="max-width: 1000px;"> 
  The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) facility consists of an array of twelve telescopes designed 
  to make the highest-precision ground-based photometric observations of exoplanet transits.  Our scientific focus is 
  finding and characterising planets that are suitable for detailed study with
  large facilities, particularly those of ESO, which are co-located with NGTS in Chile.
  The NGTS facility is described in more detail <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.4476W/abstract">here</a> and in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.4476W/abstract">this journal article</a>. 

  <!--<br><br>
  The twelve NGTS telescopes are 20cm f/2.8 astrographs fitted with 
  back-illuminated deep-depletion e2v CCDs. The system is optimised for the red optical (520-890nm), which maximises sensitivity to small stars and hence small exoplanets. 
  Our pixel scale is 5arsec/pix, and the twelve telescopes together cover an instantaneous field of view of 96 square degrees. Each telescope is mounted on an independently-steerable equatorial mount, allowing for 
  efficient monitoring of many targets spread across the sky. We can also observe the same target with multiple telescpes to maximise photometric precision (matching the precison of the NASA TESS mission). 
  The telescope mounts enable auto-guiding to a precision of 0.04 pixels, which is key to our photometric precision. 
  <br><br>
  We observe with high cadence, usually 12s, which prevents saturation of bright stars, ensures exoplanet transits are well sampled, and enables 
  science projects studying rapid stellar variability. 
  This high cadence is a key strength of the project, as most sky surveys are not senesitive to rapid variability. 
  It leads to a high data rate, with 33M science images processed to date (235 TB), and more than 300,000,000,000 photometric measurements made of nearly 3 million stars.

        NGTS is located at the 
        ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile, 
        which also hosts the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and neighbours the Cerro Armazones site of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).  This is the best site in the world for our science, with an exceptional 78% of photometric nights, 
        and extremely dry conditions that minimises noise at red wavelengths due to water absorption. NGTS was the first non-ESO facility granted access to Paranal, reflecting 
        how our high-precision photometry complements the capabilities of ESO facilities. ESO provides generous in-kind support to NGTS, including a public data archive that provides access for the wider astronomical community. 
        <br><br> 
        The NGTS facility was constructed by a consortium of six institutes, including four UK universities: Warwick, Cambridge, Leicester and Queen's Belfast, together with Geneva Observatory and Berlin planetary science group of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which 
        is the PI institute for the ESA PLATO mission. The consortium also includes representatives of the Chilean astronomical community and we have been joined by scientists from many other institutes, 
        including Queen Mary University of London, University of Oxford, Universty of Sheffield, University of Southampton, the Open University and Armagh Observatory. 
        The capital costs of the facility were met by the consortium institutes, and operations are supported by the UK Science and Technology Facilties Council (STFC). 
        The NGTS facility is operated from the University of Warwick, UK, and the principal investigator is Prof. Peter Wheatley.
