  The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) facility consists of an array of twelve telescopes designed 
  to make the highest-precision ground-based photometric observations of exoplanet transits.  Our focus is 
  finding and characterising objects that are suitable for detailed study with
  large
  facilities, 
  particularly those of ESO, which are co-located with NGTS in Chile..
  The NGTS facility is described in detail <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.4476W/abstract">here</a>. 

  <br><br>
  The twelve NGTS telescopes are 20cm f/2.8 astrographs fitted with 
  back-illuminated deep-depletion e2v CCDs. The system is optimised for the red optical (550-890nm), which maximises sensitivity to small stars and hence small exoplanets. 
  Our pixel scale is 5"/pix, and the twelve telescopes together cover an instantaneous field of view of 96 square degrees. Each telescope is mounted on an independently-steerable equatorial mount, allowing for 
  efficient monitoring of many targets spread across the 
  sky. 
  These telescope mounts also enable auto-guiding to a precision of 0.04 pixels, which is key to our photometric precision. 
  <br><br>
  We observe with very high cadence, usually 12s, which prevents saturation of bright stars, ensures exoplanet transits are well sampled, and enables 
  science projects studying rapid stellar variability. 
  This high cadence is a key strength of the project, as no other time-domain survey systematically explores variability on such short time scales. 
  It leads to a high data rate, with 33M science images processed to date (235 TB), and more than 300,000,000,000 photometric measurements made of nearly 3 million stars.

        NGTS is located at the 
        ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile, 
        which also hosts the VLT. Paranal is the best site in the world for our science, with an exceptional 78% of photometric nights, and extremely dry conditions that minimises noise at red wavelengths due to water absorption. NGTS was the first non-ESO facility granted access to Paranal, reflecting 
        how our high-precision photometry complements the capabilities of 
        ESO facilities. ESO provides generous in-kind support to NGTS, including access to the Paranal site without charge. ESO also contributes the public data archive for NGTS, 
        providing access for the wider astronomical community. 
        <br><br>
        The NGTS project is led from the UK (Wheatley chairs the NGTS Board) and the facility is operated from the University of Warwick. 
        The facility was constructed by a consortium of six institutes, including four UK universities: Warwick, Cambridge, Leicester and Queen's Belfast. We have since been joined by scientists at four other UK institutes: Queen Mary, Oxford, Sheffield and Armagh Observatory. Our international partners include the Geneva Observatory, 
        with expertise in precision radial-velocity measurements, 
        and the Berlin planetary science group of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which 
        is the PI institute for the ESA PLATO mission.  The capital costs of the facility were approximately ??2.5m and were met by the consortium institutes.
