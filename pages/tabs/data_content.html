  NGTS data are proprietary to members of the NGTS consortium for one year after the completion of a survey season. 
However, we welcome enquiries from astronomers and institutes interested in joining the NGTS consortium and participating 
in our working groups. Since NGTS operations are funded by STFC, we particularly encourage enquiries from UK scientists.

  NGTS data are also made publicly available though the ESO Data Archive. To date we have made two data releases: the first in 
November 2018, which included 32 billion measurements covering 200,000 stars (1.7 TB); and the second in July 2020, with 110 
billion measurements covering 600,000 stars (4 TB).
  
  If you would like advice on using NGTS data in your research, please don't hesitate to contact us.
  
  Please note that any publications making use of NGTS data must include the following acknowledgment: "Based on data collected under the NGTS Project at the ESO La Silla Paranal Observatory."

  <h1 class="w3-center">Hints and Tips</h1>
  <p style="padding:0px 10px" class="w3-left"> 
    The NGTS fields are surveyed intensely but scattered apparently randomly across the sky. Consequently, a cone/box search for individual objects is not a natural way to access the data.

    From the source catalogue query page, just hitting "search & view" without including any coordinates returns a list of all objects in the data release, which can be downloaded in a range of formats. This might be useful if you want to run your own cross match using e.g. topcat.

    If the sesame name resolver doesn't resolve the name of your target, you can try typing the coordinates of any of the sources returned above, which should take you to back to the catalogue entry and confirms the cone search is working.

    It is also possible to run cone/box searches across a list of objects using the "List of targets" tab.

    If you the put the source ID of one of these objects into the light curve catalogue query page, you can see and download the actual photometry.

    There are also other ways to access the data through the ESO archive. It is possible to browse the sky footprints of NGTS using the ESO Science Portal (Processed data), by (for instance) selecting the NGTS filter from the Filter/Band list.

    It is also possible to find and download the image and photometry fits files for whole fields using the data products form. Although note that each NGTS field has been divided into 25 subfields in order to keep the file size manageable for the archive.

    It should help to look at the documentation, which includes a list of the fields included in the data release.
