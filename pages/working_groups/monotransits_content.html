  While thousands of transiting exoplanets are now known, the observed population is very strongly biased towards hot, close-in planets with short orbital periods (typically < 10d; NASA Exoplanet Archive - accessed 2023-01-25).  This is due to decreasing transit probability with wider orbital separation and the practical difficulty of detecting and confirming long-period transit signals.  The result of this bias is that most well studied giant planets have equilibrium temperatures greater than 1000K (2018AJ....156..103K).  To study giant planet atmospheres at temperatures closer to those in our own Solar System, we need to discover longer period transiting exoplanets.  Such planets will provide our best opportunities to characterise the warm/cool planetary atmospheres using techniques such as transmission spectroscopy (2016Natur.529...59S) or phase curves (2021A&A...653A.173M).

  Wide field ground-based photometric surveys such as WASP (2006PASP..118.1407P), HAT-Net/HATSouth (2018haex.bookE.111B), and KELT (2007PASP..119..923P) seldom detect transiting exoplanet systems longer than about 10 days. Radial velocity surveys have been successful in characterising a spectroscopic orbit for many cool planets (e.g. 2022ApJS..262...21F,2011A&A...535A..54S). In particular, there have been instances of planets discovered by radial velocity measurements which have then been confirmed as a single-transit in TESS (2020MNRAS.496.4330D). However, radial velocity surveys detect planets with a greater range of orbital inclinations and only a handful will be suitable for transit spectroscopy.

  The NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; 2015JATIS...1a4003R) mission is a wide-field photometric survey that is sensitive to exoplanet transits on bright stars across most of the sky.  TESS observes most stars for 27 days during a single Sector, so for orbital periods longer than 13.5 days TESS may only observe a single transit event during a Sector. Simulations show that hundreds of long-period planets around bright stars should be detectable as single transit events in TESS data, with orbital periods extending up to hundreds of days (2018A&A...619A.175C,2019AJ....157...84V).  However single transits require extensive follow-up to determine the true orbital period.  Spectroscopic follow-up is very useful as each observation will help constrain the mass and eccentricity, along with the orbital period.  However there are a limited number of spectrographs on large telescopes capable of this follow-up, and these instruments are already over-subscribed monitoring multi-transit event TESS exoplanet candidates. Therefore, photometric follow-up plays an essential role in determining the true period for these single-transit event TESS candidates (2021MNRAS.500.5088C).

  In the first extended TESS mission, most of the stars monitored in Year 1 or Year 2 were observed for a second time.  In some cases targets will exhibit a second transit event in the extended mission, making the candidate a ‘duotransit’ (2022A&A...664A.156O).  In such cases a finite number of period aliases are allowed, greatly reducing the amount of telescope time required for photometric follow-up.  However for candidates with orbital periods longer than approximately 20 days there are still many candidates that remain as single transit events after being observed in two TESS Sectors.  These candidates remain our best source of long period transiting planets from TESS, but also require the most demanding follow-up campaigns.

  Sam Gill leads the monotransit working group established within the Next-Generation Transit Survey (2018MNRAS.475.4476W). The aim of the working group is to recover the orbital periods and characterise TESS monotransit and duotransit candidates. NGTS is an array of twelve 20-cm telescopes at the ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile.  Each NGTS  telescope has been designed for high- precision photometry, that matches TESS for most stars and for the brightest stars by using multiple telescopes. Each of the 12 NGTS telescopes has a field-of-view of 8 square degrees, providing sufficient reference stars for even the brightest TESS candidates. The telescopes observe with a custom filter between 520-890nm and are specifically designed for precise photometry of exoplanet transits. The twelve independently mounted telescopes means that NGTS is one of the few ground-based facilities capable of monitoring several TESS monotransit and duotransit candidates simultaneously on a given night. We have monitored a sample of these objects with the NGTS telescopes and, to date, we have successfully recovered additional transit events for over 100 planet candidates, of which 57 have fully recovered orbital periods.
