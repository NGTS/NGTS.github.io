      <b> August 2025:</b> In August of 2025 the city of Albuquerque New Mexico played host to astronomers from the NGTS consortium visiting the <a href="https://www.unm.edu">University of New Mexico</a> for a workshop titled <a href="https://transitstotrends.github.io">From Transits to Trends: the Next Decade of Long-Period Exoplanets</a>. The workshop saw members of the scientific community from across the world gather together to discuss and strategise long-period transiting planet science with many contributions from members of the NGTS long-period planet working group. After the workshop had ended a few members of the consortium enjoyed a road-trip across the plains of New Mexico and ended up, among many other (mis)adventures, recording a podcast with some local amateur astronomers which you can listen to <a href="https://www.skylapser.com/podcast/deep-sage-nine-starcast-episode-016/">here</a>. The consortium would like to offer its congratulations and thanks to the SOC and LOC for organising a very enjoyable and constructive workshop.
