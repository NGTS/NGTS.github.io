      <b> January 2025:</b>. Hot Jupiters are a class of planet roughly equal in size to Jupiter but extremely close to their host star, with the extreme radiation causing them to be very hot. Two recent publications led by members of the NGTS consortium have added three newly discovered hot Jupiters to the sample of known Exoplanets. NGTS-31 b and 32b were both published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/536/3/2011/7912567">Vines, et al,. (2025)</a>. Both planets orbit subgiant stars, i.e. stars which are nearing the end of their lives and just beginning to evolve into red giants. Both are also found to be highly inflated, meaning their measured radii are very large compared to their measured masses. NGTS-33 b was published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/536/2/1538/7905049">Alves, et al., (2025)</a> and is notable for being found around a young hot star. Young exoplanets are rare and provide special insight into the earliest stages of planetary evolution.
