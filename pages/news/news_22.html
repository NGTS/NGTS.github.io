      <b>Apr 2024:</b> NGTS is discovering and characterising transiting exoplanets on long orbital periods - 
      one such discovery is NGTS-30 b. Originally identified as a single transit in TESS data, monitoring with the 
      NGTS facility and other ground-based telescopes and spectrographs revealed an orbital period of 98 days. The 
      planet has an orbital eccentricity of 0.29, meaning that its equilibrium temperature will vary between 274 and 
      500 K during its orbit. It is also metal-enriched compared to its host star, which itself is one of the youngest 
      stars (1.1 Gyr) with a well-characterised long-period planetary companion.
