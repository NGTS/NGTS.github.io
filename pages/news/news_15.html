        Of the eleven observatories around the world trying to detect the transit of HIP 41378f, only NGTS was successful. This extraordinary transiting planet has an extremely low density and an orbital period of 542 days. The NGTS transit is only the third to be detected, and the first detected from the ground. It reveals a transit time two hours earlier than expected, most likely due to the gravitational attraction of other planets in the system. Future observations will help establish the total number of planets and their masses.
