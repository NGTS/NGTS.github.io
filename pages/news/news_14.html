        TOI-178 is a remarkably close-packed plantary system, with a wide range of planet densities, in which five of the planets are in chain of mean-motion resonances. Initially identified by TESS, NGTS played a crucial role in unraveling the orbital periods of the planets, ruling out one proposed planet, and confirming two others. The system places important constraints on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/rhythmic_six-exoplanet_system/">Read the Warwick press release</a> and the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/504/1/L45/6228864">full journal article</a>.
