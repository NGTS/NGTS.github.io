        <b>Nov 2022: Warwick PhD student Eva-Maria Ahrer has led the publication of one of the first 
            studies of an exoplanet atmosphere using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The results 
            show detections of water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of WASP-39b, but an absence of 
            methane. This combination suggests a relative lack of carbon in that atmosphere compared to 
            oxygen, which provides an important clue to where the planet formed. As part of this study, 
            NGTS made a series of observations of the host star of the planet in order to demonstrate the 
            JWST spectrum was free of contamination by stellar activity.
