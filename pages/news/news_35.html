      <b> November 2025:</b> Just a handful of giant exoplanets that transit their host star with a period of more than 100 days are known. Such 'warm' exoplanets are key for testing planet formation and migration mechanisms at wide separations and make excellent targets for atmospheric studies. NGTS-36 b (also known as TOI-2449) is a Jupiter-sized planet that originally had one transit detected by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. NGTS performed follow up photometric observations, and jointly modelling this photometric data with radial velocity data determined the orbital period to be a huge 106 days! NGTS-36 b joins the small population of >100-day period transiting exoplanets and is well suited to further observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and atmospheric characterisation.
