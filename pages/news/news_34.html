      <b> October 2025:</b> The Planet Hunters NGTS project that engages the help of the general public to help us detect planets and other interesting phenomena in NGTS data has discovered a binary star system that we’ve called “NGTS-EB-8.” This system was first detected by citizen scientists and presented as a planet candidate in the first Planet Hunters NGTS paper last year (<a href="https://ngtransits.org/pages/news/news_23_page.html">read more about it here</a>). Further observations of the system with NIRPS and GHOST revealed it to in fact be an eclipsing binary composed of two very similar M-dwarfs. Eclipsing binaries are excellent benchmark systems for calibrating different techniques for determining stellar parameters, while low-mass EBs such as NGTS-EB-8 have further importance in the diagnosis of the “radius inflation problem” for low-mass stars, where the observed radii of these stars is larger than theoretical models predict. NGTS-EB-8 itself agrees well with the theoretical predictions, thus will be a valuable system in determining to what extent the radius inflation problem persists. The article is to be published in the Astronomical Journal and you can read it at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11575">link here</a>.
