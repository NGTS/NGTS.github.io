      <b> April 2025:</b> In April 2025, members of the NGTS consortium travelled to the <a href="https://ast.leeds.ac.uk/">University of Leeds</a> to 
      participate in the UK Exoplanet Meeting (UKEXOM). Consortium members presented posters and talks on a variety of current research projects, from new exoplanet 
      and eclipsing binary discoveries, supporting observations we have provided for external projects and an overview of NGTS' capabilities and what it 
      can do for the UK community. See the <a href="/pages/gallery/ukexom2025/gallery_page.html">gallery page</a> for a full set of NGTS-related posters and talks. 
      The NGTS consortium additionally extends its thanks to the LOC and SOC for putting on a wonderful conference.
