      <b> September 2024:</b>. Brown dwarfs are objects which are too massive to be considered planets but not massive enough to be stars. NGTS has recently helped to discover one such object, TOI-2490 b. This brown dwarf is part of what is called the 'brown dwarf desert' which is the name given to the lack of brown dwarfs orbiting relatively close to host stars. TOI-2490 b is not just rare for its close orbit but also the extreme orbital eccentricity of 0.77989 which is the highest of any brown dwarf in the desert at the time of discovery and means the brown dwarf is almost 8 times further from the star at the furthest point of it's orbit compared to the closest. This high eccentricity might give some hints to the history of the system which makes TOI-2409 b an important case study for testing theories of Brown Dwarf evolution.
