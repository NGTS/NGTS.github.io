      <b> May 2024:</b> Eagle-eyed armchair astronomers have discovered five Jupiter-sized planet candidates through 
      the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-hunters-ngts">Planet Hunters NGTS</a> citizen science project. 
      The project has been running since 2021 with the aim being to 
      engage with volunteers from the general public to spot new exoplanets that may have been missed in previous searches 
      of the NGTS data. Almost 15,000 volunteers have taken part in the project to date and the discovery of five 
      previously undetected planet candidates thanks to their efforts are outlined in a paper by Sean O'Brien published in the 
      <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad32c8">Astronomical Journal</a>. The most important discovery
      so far is the detection of a candidate exoplanet, about 
      the size of Jupiter, orbiting a red dwarf star, a star smaller than our Sun. This is a rare find by the 
      volunteers with only around a dozen giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars ever discovered, including 
      <a href="https://ngtransits.org/pages/news/news_4_page.html">NGTS-1 b</a>, and 
      poses interesting questions about how these systems can form. Volunteers can be any age, from anywhere in the 
      world and no training is required; all you need is a web browser to begin searching for exoplanets.
