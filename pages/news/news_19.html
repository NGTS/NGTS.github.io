      <b>Nov 2023:</b> NGTS has contributed observations of the HD 110067 system, a unique set of six sub-Neptunes 
      locked in highly resonant orbits around their bright host star. NGTS observed the transit of HD 110067 f, 
      simultaneously using nine telescopes to help confirm its orbital period of 41 days. Systems displaying strong 
      orbital resonances can assist in our understanding of the formation and evolution of these extremely rare 
      resonant multi-planet systems - passing objects and impact events can disrupt this resonance. Sub-Neptune 
      planets are also highly amenable to studies of planetary atmospheres with missions such as JWST and Ariel.
