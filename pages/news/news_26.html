      <b> August 2024:</b> Five of the six planets transiting the star TOI-178 are locked in a 
      <a href="https://ngtransits.org/pages/news/news_14_page.html">rhythmic dance</a> with each 
      other as they orbit around their host star. Throughout this dance, the planets interact with one another, causing the 
      transit events of each planet to not occur strictly periodically. NGTS has contributed to the observational monitoring 
      of the dance of these planets and the times at which their transits occur. Along with the TESS and CHEOPS space missions,
      NGTS observed transits of the TOI-178 planets. These transit timings are used to map out the dance and interactions of the 
      planets to measure their masses. The dancing planets (TOI-178 c to g) were found to have masses between 3.48 to 5.63 times 
      the mass of the Earth. Read the <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/08/aa50212-24/aa50212-24.html">full journal article</a>.
