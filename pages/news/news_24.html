      <b> May 2024:</b> Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that sit between stars and planets in mass, 
      meaning they do not have sufficient mass to start nuclear fusion like stars. Unlike planets, 
      they are extremely rare on close orbits around main sequence stars with only ~40 such systems 
      known. NGTS has identified and studied a new brown dwarf, NGTS-28Ab, orbiting an M1 host, using 
      supporting observations from both space and the ground to characterise and confirm the system. 
      NGTS-28Ab orbits the primary star of an M dwarf binary on a short period of 1.25 days, and has a 
      mass close to the hydrogen burning limit of 69 MJup. This makes it one of the shortest period 
      brown dwarfs in this region known as the brown dwarf desert, and one of the highest mass brown 
      dwarfs found to be orbiting an M-dwarf star.
