        NGTS-1b is a rare Jupiter-sized exoplanet found orbiting a small M-dwarf host star. The red sensitivity and high precision of the NGTS telescopes enabled this doscovery, which challenges theories of planet formation that link the maximum mass of a planet with the mass its host star and its associated protoplanetary disc.
