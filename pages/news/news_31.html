      <b> February 2025:</b>. Members of the NGTS consortium have published one of the longest-period eclipsing binary (EB) systems ever discovered. NGTS-EB-7 consists of a primary star (NGTS-EB-7 A) slightly larger than our sun but significantly older and beginning to swell in size and a secondary star (NGTS-EB-7 B) which is only slightly larger than jupiter (but over a hundred times as massive). The smaller secondary star completes an orbit around the larger primary every 198 days making NGTS-EB-7 the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary less than 200 times the mass of Jupiter. M dwarf Stars like NGTS-EB-7 B are the most common in our galaxy but their small size and cooler temperatures make them inherently faint and difficult to study. By studying systems like NGTS-EB-7 where these stars orbit bright hosts we can measure their properties relative to their hosts and begin to understand their fundamental properties. This is important if we want to understand the planetary systems that form around these kinds of stars like the remarkable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1">TRAPPIST-1</a> system.
