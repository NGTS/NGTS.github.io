      <b> Feb 2024:</b> Dr Faith Hawthorn and Dr Sam Gill from the long-period planets working group of NGTS conducted 
      a new search of the TESS data for planets that are ‘duotransiting’ - meaning they transit once in Cycle 1, and 
      once in Cycle 3. This allows planets to be found at longer orbital periods, anywhere between 20 and 700 days – 
      most TESS exoplanets have periods from 3-10 days. Of the 85 planets found in the study, 60 of them are new and 
      have been contributed to the TESS follow-up efforts as CTOIs (Community TESS Objects of Interest). The team hopes 
      that researchers around the world will help in the efforts to study and confirm these new planets. Read the
