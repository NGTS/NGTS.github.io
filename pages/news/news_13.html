        <b>26 Sep 2020: </b> Along with the rest of the ESO Paranal Obseravtory, NGTS has been closed since March due to COVID-19 restrictions. Thanks to the robotic nature of the NGTS telescopes, we are able to resume operations now that ESO is in a position to provide emergency cover for the facility.
