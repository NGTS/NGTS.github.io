      <b>Apr 2024:</b> NGTS has led a study into two new transiting exoplanets, both of which are strongly irradiated 
      by their host stars and have highly inflated radii. NGTS-26 b orbits a G6-type main sequence star on a period of 
      4.52 days, and has a Saturn-like mass of 0.29 MJup, but its radius of 1.33 RJup makes it one of the largest objects 
      amongst planets with similar masses. NGTS-27 b orbits an evolved G3-type star on a period of 3.37 days, and has 
      a mass of 0.59 MJup and radius of 1.4 RJup. Studying such gas giants that orbit close to their stars helps astronomers 
      to understand how these planets evolve, inflate and survive in such extreme environments.
