        NGTS-10b is a hot Jupiter that orbits its host star in just 18 hours. This is the shortest year of any known giant planet. Its extreme proximity to its parent star is expected to drive intense tidal interactions that will decay its orbit, forcing the planet to spiral ever closer. It is likely that we have caught NGTS-10b shortly before it spirals into its star and is lost forever.
