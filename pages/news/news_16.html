        <b>Mar 2022: NGTS searches for more exoplanets with citizen scientists!</b> <a href="https://ngts.planethunters.org">Planet Hunters NGTS</a> launched in October 2021 allowing members of the public to 
        join our search for more exoplanets. Zooniverse volunteers classify phase-folded light curves according to the shape of any transits (U or V)
         and whether there is stellar variability or large data gaps in the images presented. Since launch, over 2.6 million classifications have been made by over 7000
          volunteers on archival and fresh NGTS data! The volunteers also vet the most promising light curves with secondary eclipse
           and odd/even transit checks to spot any eclipsing binaries. The project has already detected previously known planets such as NGTS-5b (below)
            and the team continues to sift the data to find anything missed by the NGTS eyeballing team. Follow the progress <a href="https://twitter.com/PH_NGTS">@PH_NGTS</a>.
