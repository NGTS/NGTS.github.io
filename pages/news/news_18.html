        <p> </p>‘Dippers’ are a new class of variable star that show large drops in brightness of up to 50%,
        lasting anywhere from a few hours to a few days. NGTS has led a search of these dipper stars in the Orion
        Complex using machine learning methods, identifying 120 new dippers - the largest number to be identified 
        in a single cluster to date. The team also determined that around 28 per cent of stars with disks are dipper 
        stars, and all of the dippers in the sample were found to have disks themselves.
