      <b> September 2025:</b> Atreides is the noble house of Paul, protagonist of Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi epic novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">DUNE</a>. It is also the name of a recently launched astronomical programme, Ancestry, Traits, and Relations of Exoplanets Inhabiting the Desert Edges and Savanna (ATREIDES). This "Neptune" Desert is the name given to the relative lack of Neptune sized planets on close-in orbits compared to Jupiter-sized giant planets and smaller rocky planets. The ATREIDES programme aims to shed light on this relative dearth of planets by measuring the spin-orbit alignment of planets around the edges of the desert region using the <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso.html">ESPRESSO</a> spectrograph which can tell us about their formational and migrational history. NGTS has and will continue to contribute to this programme by observing photometric transits of the target planets. This helps narrow down the timing of future transits for the ESPRESSO observations and can indicate potential sources of stellar noise.
