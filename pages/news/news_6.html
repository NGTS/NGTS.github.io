        <b>Apr 2019: Giant flare detected from coolest star seen to exhbit a white-light flare.</b> The star has a temperature of only 2000K (an L2.5 dwarf) and it is only a tenth the size of the Sun. During the flare it suddenly became ten thousand times brighter than normal, with an energy ten times greater than the largest flare ever seen on the Sun.
