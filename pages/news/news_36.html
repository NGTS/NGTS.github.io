      <b> December 2025:</b> Long period planets present observational challenges that make their orbital period difficult to nail down, leading to fewer confirmed transiting exoplanets beyond ≈10 days. These longer orbits where planets are less affected by their host star are desirable for studying planet formation scenarios, exoplanetary system architectures, and the atmospheres of cooler exoplanets. NGTS consortium members have been involved in publishing three such new planets as our 100th paper!
      The smallest of the three is NGTS-34b, a Neptune-sized planet on a 43 day orbit. This makes it one of the top few longest period well-characterized transiting Neptunes. Orbiting a bright star, it has high potential for future atmospheric studies using JWST or Ariel. Next largest is a rare warm Saturn-sized planet TOI-4940b, on a 25 day orbit around its host star. The largest of the three is NGTS-35b, another warm Saturn. This planet is also on a wide 25 day orbit, but its orbit eccentric and it is hosted by a cooler K-dwarf star. All three planets have equilibrium temperatures below 700K, but NGTS-35b is particularly cool at 450K, in a regime where chemical transitions could be especially favourable to studying its atmosphere to find out how it formed. These three warm giants add to the small but growing population of long period planets that can further our understanding of planet formation mechanisms, and link exoplanets to our own Solar System.
