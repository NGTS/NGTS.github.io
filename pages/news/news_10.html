        <b>Jul 2020: </b> Published in Nature, NGTS confirmed the TESS detection of transits of TOI-849b, a dense planetary core found deep in the Neptunian desert. The NGTS light curve was also crucial for defining the shape of the transit, which was blurred by the 30 min cadence of the TESS full-frame data.  <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/first_exposed_planetary/">Read the Warwick press release</a>, the  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10314.pdf">full preprint</a> or the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2421-7">original Nature article</a>.
