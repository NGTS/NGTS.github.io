        NGTS-4b is sub-Neptune sized planet only three times the size of the Earth. The transit is by far the shallowest ever discovered from the ground, only 0.13% deep. The planet is situated very close to it K-type host star, in a region where Neptune-sized planets are thought to be photoevaporated by the high-energy emission of the star.
